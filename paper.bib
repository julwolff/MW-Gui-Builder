abstract = {Summary
The impact of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in molecular biology and drug discovery has expanded dramatically in recent years. These simulations capture the behavior of proteins and other biomolecules in full atomic detail and at very fine temporal resolution. Major improvements in simulation speed, accuracy, and accessibility, together with the proliferation of experimental structural data, have increased the appeal of biomolecular simulation to experimentalists—a trend particularly noticeable in, although certainly not limited to, neuroscience. Simulations have proven valuable in deciphering functional mechanisms of proteins and other biomolecules, in uncovering the structural basis for disease, and in the design and optimization of small molecules, peptides, and proteins. Here we describe, in practical terms, the types of information MD simulations can provide and the ways in which they typically motivate further experimental work.}

    abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become a powerful tool for investigating electrical double layers (EDLs), which play a crucial role in various electrochemical devices. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the techniques used in MD simulations for EDL studies, with a particular focus on methods for describing electrode polarization, and examine the principle behind these methods and their varying applicability. The applications of these approaches in supercapacitors, capacitive deionization, batteries, and electric double-layer transistors are explored, highlighting recent advancements and insights in each field. Finally, we emphasize the challenges and potential directions for future developments in MD simulations of EDLs, such as considering movable electrodes, improving electrode property representation, incorporating chemical reactions, and enhancing computational efficiency to deepen our understanding of complex electrochemical processes and contribute to the progress in the field involving EDLs.},

   abstract = "Many key industrial processes, from electricity production, conversion, and storage to electrocatalysis or electrochemistry in general, rely on physical mechanisms occurring at the interface between a metallic electrode and an electrolyte solution, summarized by the concept of an electric double layer, with the accumulation/depletion of electrons on the metal side and of ions on the liquid side. While electrostatic interactions play an essential role in the structure, thermodynamics, dynamics, and reactivity of electrode-electrolyte interfaces, these properties also crucially depend on the nature of the ions and solvent, as well as that of the metal itself. Such interfaces pose many challenges for modeling because they are a place where quantum chemistry meets statistical physics. In the present review, we explore the recent advances in the description and understanding of electrode-electrolyte interfaces with classical molecular simulations, with a focus on planar interfaces and solvent-based liquids, from pure solvent to water-in-salt electrolytes.",

    abstract = {Electrochemistry is central to many applications, ranging from biology to energy science. Studies now involve a wide range of techniques, both experimental and theoretical. Modeling and simulations methods, such as density functional theory or molecular dynamics, provide key information on the structural and dynamic properties of the systems. Of particular importance are polarization effects of the electrode/electrolyte interface, which are difficult to simulate accurately. Here, we show how these electrostatic interactions are taken into account in the framework of the Ewald summation method. We discuss, in particular, the formal setup for calculations that enforce periodic boundary conditions in two directions, a geometry that more closely reflects the characteristics of typical electrolyte/electrode systems and presents some differences with respect to the more common case of periodic boundary conditions in three dimensions. These formal developments are implemented and tested in MetalWalls, a molecular dynamics software that captures the polarization of the electrolyte and allows the simulation of electrodes maintained at a constant potential. We also discuss the technical aspects involved in the calculation of two sets of coupled degrees of freedom, namely the induced dipoles and the electrode charges. We validate the implementation, first on simple systems, then on the well-known interface between graphite electrodes and a room-temperature ionic liquid. We finally illustrate the capabilities of MetalWalls by studying the adsorption of a complex functionalized electrolyte on a graphite electrode.},
